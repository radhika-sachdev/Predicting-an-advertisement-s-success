# Predicting-an-advertisement-s-success

The advertisement data, obtained from Kaggle, is explored to find various insights on how certain features affect an Adâ€™s success. We assessed the scope of revenue that could be generated by a proposed ad and further predicted whether the revenue generated will cover costs to produce and air the ad. 

Based on our prediction results and overall insights, our analysis has been selected out of a class of 60 students to be published in an upcoming Data Science Book series "Data Science and its applications" - by http://thenativetribe.org/
